### About Me

Hola! I’m Tamara Aránguiz-Rago, a tectonic geomorphologist and a Ph.D. Candidate in Earth and Space Sciences at the University of Washington, Seattle. Originally from Santiago, Chile, I moved to the US in September 2020 after receiving a Fulbright Doctorate Fellowship, which has been instrumental in my academic journey. When I was awarded the fellowship, I didn’t speak English, but I worked hard to learn it and am now fluent—though still always improving!

My research interests are centered on how landscapes archive both past and present tectonic and surface processes. I’m particularly interested in how we can disentangle tectonic and climate signals to better understand the dynamics of these processes. I work across multiple scales and techniques, combining **field observations, remote sensing, geochronological data, and numerical simulations** to inform physical and mathematical models of erosion and fault systems.

During my PhD my research areas focus on **strike-slip fault landscapes and their evolution across timescales**. I spend a lot of time using tools like GIS and coding for data analysis, but I also love to spend time collecting geological constraints in the field. Teaching and mentoring are also incredibly important to me—particularly **mentoring students from marginalized communities**, ensuring they thrive and succeed in STEM fields.
