My name is Tamara Ar√°nguiz-Rago, I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Earth and Spaces Sciences at the University of Washington, Seattle, USA. 

- I was born and raised in Santiago de Chile, and I moved to the US in September 2020.
- I got a Fulbright Doctorate Fellowship to fund my PhD in the US. I didn't speak English when I got it, so I had to learn it. Now I'm fluent but I'm still learning.
- I'm interested in active tectonics and surface processes and in my PhD dissertation, I combine a suite of techniques from field observations, remote sensing, numerical simulations, and geochronology.  
- I'm moved by working for an anti-racist, equitable, and welcoming community in Geosciences that can flourish from a diversity of perspectives.
