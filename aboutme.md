subtitle: Hola! I'm a Geoscientist that would like to be a comedian

My name is Tamara Aranguiz, I'm pursuing my Ph.D. in Earth and Spaces Sciences in the University of Washington, Seattle, USA. 

- I was born and raised in Santiago de Chile, and I moved to the US in September 2020.
- I'm interesed in active tectonics and surface deformation. So, I'm working with geomorphological and geodetical observations in Northern Chile, stuyding a strike-slip fault system to contribute to the knowledge of  upper crustal fault in subduction zone settings.
- I got a Fulbright Scholarship to fund my PhD in the US. I didn't speak English when I got it, so I had to learn it. Now I'm fluent but I'm still learning! 
- As Latina I'm moved by working for a more equitable and diverse community in Geosciences. I'm part of Geolatinas and CoCo, an NSF funded bilingual project to teach programming and science communication skills for Hispanic and Latinx grad students. 

What else I can say?

### My story

I'm a first gen! I have never heard about a Ph.D. until I went to university and realized that if I wanted to be a proffessor I had to get that degreee.  

having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
