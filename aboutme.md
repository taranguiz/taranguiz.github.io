My name is Tamara Ar√°nguiz-Rago, I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Earth and Spaces Sciences at the University of Washington, Seattle, USA. 

- I was born and raised in Santiago de Chile, and I moved to the US in September 2020.
- I got a Fulbright Doctorate Fellowship to fund my PhD in the US. I didn't speak English when I got it, so I had to learn it. Now I'm fluent but I'm still learning!
- I'm interested in active tectonics and surface deformation. I'm working with multiple geological and geophysical methods across timescales in Northern Chile, studying the Atacama Fault System to contribute to our understanding of upper crustal faults in subduction zone settings and knowledge about strike-slip faults in general.
- I'm moved by working for an anti-racist, equitable, and welcoming community in Geosciences that can flourish from a diversity of perspectives.
