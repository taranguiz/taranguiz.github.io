My name is Tamara Ar√°nguiz-Rago, I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Earth and Spaces Sciences at the University of Washington, Seattle, USA. 

- I was born and raised in Santiago de Chile, and I moved to the US in September 2020.
- I'm interested in active tectonics and surface deformation. So, I'm working with multiple geological and geophysical methods across timescales in Northern Chile, studying the Salar Grande strike-slip fault system to contribute to the knowledge of  upper crustal faults in subduction zone settings.
- I got a Fulbright Scholarship to fund my PhD in the US. I didn't speak English when I got it, so I had to learn it. Now I'm fluent but I'm still learning! 
- As a Latina and part of an underrepresented group in science, I'm moved by working for a more equitable and diverse community in Geosciences.
