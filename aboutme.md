My name is Tamara Aranguiz, I'm pursuing my Ph.D. in Earth and Spaces Sciences in the University of Washington, Seattle, USA. 

- I was born and raised in Santiago de Chile, and I moved to the US in September 2020.
- I'm interesed in active tectonics and surface deformation. So, I'm working with geomorphological and geodetical observations in Northern Chile, studying the Salar Grande strike-slip fault system to contribute to the knowledge of  upper crustal faults in subduction zone settings.
- I got a Fulbright Scholarship to fund my PhD in the US. I didn't speak English when I got it, so I had to learn it. Now I'm fluent but I'm still learning! 
- As Latina and part of underrepresented group in science, I'm moved by working for a more equitable and diverse community in Geosciences. 
- I'm hyperactive since I was very little. Now I use my energy climbing, running, biking and dancing.
- I did improv for many years as part of the cast of a theater company in Chile. In fact, I have an actress certificate after completing a conservatory in Improvisational Theater and Comedy. I use my communication skills in my science everytime that I can.   

### My story

I'm a first gen! I have never heard about a Ph.D. until I went to university and realized that if I wanted to be a professor and researcher I had to get that degree.
