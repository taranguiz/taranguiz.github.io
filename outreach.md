### CoCo: Code to communicate 

- After starting my programming journey with my Ph.D., I have been really motivated to gain expertise in Data Science. I have the pleasure to be part of CoCo: [code to communicate](https://www.codecommunicate.org/about). 
CoCo is an NSF-funded bilingual project addressed to Latinx and Hispanic students to give them skills in programming and science communication. I love CoCo and our team! As of April 2024, I am a coding coordinator and we are looking to open our program to a community, so stay tuned! 
- Read about our program in our article [here](https://tos.org/oceanography/article/code-to-communicate-empowering-bilingual-connections-in-earth-science).

### SZ4Grads

- I am one of the co-founders of SZ4Grads: subduction zones for graduate students. SZ4Grads is a collaborative, interdisciplinary, and intercultural network for graduate students and recent graduates studying subduction zone processes. We are under the umbrella of SZ4D and part of the Building Equity and Capacity with Geoscience (BECG) integrative group. Our community is composed of graduate students, post-docs, and non-faculty researchers (<5 years from their terminal degree) from different disciplines and backgrounds.

Join the community and learn more [here](https://www.sz4d.org/sz4grads)! 

### GeoLatinas 

- I'm part of this amazing group! [Geolatinas](https://geolatinas.weebly.com) empower and embrace Latinas pursuing careers in Earth and Space Sciences. 
Finding this network made me feel supported and motivated to continue with my research while living in a foreign country. 
I found community and other people like me struggling with similar problems.
