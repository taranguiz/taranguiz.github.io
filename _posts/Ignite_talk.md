During AGU 2021 in New Orleans, LA, I had the pleasure to give an Ignite talk. 
**What is an ignite talk?** 
Ignite is an strict format where speakers have 5 minutes to talk on a subject accompanied by 20 slides, for 15 seconds each, automatically advanced.

AGU MEETING has their own version (https://igniteagu.io) 
Here is my talk if you want to watch it!
