**CoCo: Code to Communicate** is a Bilingual (Spanish-English) program designed to provide coding and science communication training for graduate students in
Geosciences. The training sessions are in both English and Spanish languages to reach historically excluded students within Latin and Hispanic communities.

I'm excited and honored to be part of the team of trainers, meeting amazing people and strengthening my knowledge in python applied to geosciences.
