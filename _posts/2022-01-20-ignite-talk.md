During AGU 2021 in New Orleans, LA, I had the pleasure to give an Ignite talk. 
## **What is an ignite talk?** 
Ignite is an strict format where speakers have 5 minutes to talk on a subject accompanied by 20 slides, for 15 seconds each, automatically advanced.

AGU meeting has their [own  version](https://igniteagu.io) 
Here is [my talk](https://www.wevideo.com/view/2514477615) if you want to watch it! 

*Spoiler!* I talk about my research in the Atacama Desert trying to estimate the slip rate of the Salar Grande Fault (a strike-slip fault) using geodesy and geomorphology. I mix my science with my opinions and experience about diversity in Geosciences.
