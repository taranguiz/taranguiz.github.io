I am excited to share that I won the **Best Overall Talk** at the recent event with my presentation titled *"Role of sediment and climate variability in strike-slip fault arid landscapes."* It was an incredible opportunity to share my research, and Iâ€™m honored to have received this recognition.

Additionally, I participated in the **Upgoer5** challenge, where I had just 5 minutes to explain my research using only the 1000 most common words in English. I titled my talk *"Side-Fault Dance,"* performing a song about strike-slip models using the Bad Romance music (Lady Gaga). It was a fun and challenging experience that allowed me to communicate my work in a creative way.
