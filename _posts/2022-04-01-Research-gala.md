Every year in the Department of Earth and Space Sciences at the University of Washington, we celebrate and share our research. 
This year we have the opportunity to do it in person! 
I gave two talks about my research, one in the geodesy category and another one in the upgoers-5.
The [upgoers-5](https://xkcd.com/1133/) was a 5 minutes talk were I could only use the 10-hundred most common words in English. That was pretty cool and fun!

I won best talk in my two categories so I'm so thankful for the opportunity and the challenge.
