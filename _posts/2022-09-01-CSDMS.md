I enjoyed spending two months in Boulder Colorado at the CSDMS facilities advised by Dr. Gregory Tucker. 
I worked on my chapter 2 research project exploring the landscape evolution of strike-slip faults in environments with climate variability.
My funding for this project was through CSDMS. Look at this cool video of what my modeling looks like!
