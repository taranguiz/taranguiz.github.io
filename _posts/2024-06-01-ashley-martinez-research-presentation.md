I'm incredibly proud of my undergraduate mentee, **Ashley Martinez**, who presented her research at the **UW Undergraduate Symposium** on May 17, 2024. Her project, titled *"Comparative Analysis of Geomorphic Markers: Synthetic Landscapes vs. Remote Observations of Strike-Slip Faulting in Northern Chile,"* was a fantastic contribution to the symposium.

Ashley created a high-resolution DEM using structure-from-motion data of the Salar Grande Fault zone, demonstrating impressive technical skills. I had the pleasure of serving as her main mentor, working closely with her under the supervision of my advisor, **Alison Duvall**.

We connected through the [IBIS program](https://environment.uw.edu/students/current-students/identity-belonging-and-inquiry-in-science-ibis-program/), and this was Ashleyâ€™s first research experience as a junior majoring in Environmental Science and Terrestrial Resource Management (ESRM). She did an outstanding job!

**Great job, Ashley!**
