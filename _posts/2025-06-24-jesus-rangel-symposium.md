My undergrad mentee, JesÃºs Rangel (Earth and Space Sciences major, UW), presented his research at the 2025 UW Undergraduate Research Symposium. His poster is titled:

**"Caution: Slide Area! Surface Roughness Dating of Coastal Landslides Along the South Whidbey Island Fault, WA"**

This project explores the use of surface roughness metrics derived from high-resolution topographic data to estimate the relative age of landslides along the active South Whidbey Island Fault zone.

JesÃºs developed the project over six months, gaining skills in GIS, digital elevation model analysis, coding, and landscape interpretation. I'm so proud of the work he presented and his growth as a researcher!

Jesus became my mentee through the Identity, Belonging and Inquity in Science program from the College of Environment.
