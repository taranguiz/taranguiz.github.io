I would like to answer scientific questions in the tectonic geomorphology field using geodetic observations.  

I'm part of two research groups: advised by Dr. Alison Duvall in the [Geoscopes Lab](https://www.alisonrduvall.com) and co-advised by Dr. Brendan Crowell in the [Seismogeodesy Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/uwsglab/home/). My two advisors are amazing! 


**Salar Grande Fault System, Northern Chile**

- Characterization of morphotectonics of the Salar Grande Fault, located in Tarapaca Region, inmmersed in the hyper-arid core of the Atacama Desert. This first stage of the project was presented as my Preliminary Exam (09/2021).

- Estimation of slip rate of the Salar Grande fault using geomorphological offsets and gps residual motion modeling. This work was presented during AGU as a poster (12/2021).  


**Landscape Evolution Models for Strike-Slip Faults**

- Introducing the effect of sediments in channels affected by strike-slip faults. This work is an ongoing project that will be presented in the CSDMS Annual Meeting 2022 (05/2022).
